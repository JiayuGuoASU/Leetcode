[Couples Holding Hands - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/couples-holding-hands/)

N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side. A *swap* consists of choosing **any** two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

The people and seats are represented by an integer from `0` to `2N-1`, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2N-2, 2N-1)`.

The couples' initial seating is given by `row[i]` being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th seat.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: row = [0, 2, 1, 3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: row = [3, 2, 0, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.
```



**Note:**

1. `len(row)` is even and in the range of `[4, 60]`.
2. `row` is guaranteed to be a permutation of `0...len(row)-1`.

贪心算法，我也不知道为什么是对的。

但是我的第一想法就是这样的。

然后就对了。

用O(n)实现hash记录position

然后每一对都直接进行配对。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwapsCouples(vector<int>& row) {
        vector<int> pos(row.size(),0);
        for (int i=0;i<row.size();i++){
            pos[row[i]]=i;
        }
        int sum=0;
        for (int i=0;i<row.size()-1;i=i+2){
            int j;
            if (row[i]%2==0){
                j=row[i]+1;
            }else {
                j=row[i]-1;
            }
            if (row[i+1]!=j){
                int p=row[i+1];
                row[i+1]=row[pos[j]];
                row[pos[j]]=p;
                pos[p]=pos[j];
                pos[j]=i+1;
                sum++;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
